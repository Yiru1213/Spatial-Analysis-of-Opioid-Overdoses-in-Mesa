# Spatial Analysis of Opioid Overdoses in Mesa

## Introduction

This project explores the spatial pattern of overdose cases in Mesa, Arizona, and models the relationship between various risk factors and the number of overdoses. The aim of this project is to identify how demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors are associated with overdose deaths in order to improve the targeting of interventions against heroin overdoses in Mesa.

## Methods/Models

-   Ordinary Least Squares

-   Poisson Baseline Models

-   Spatial Lag Model

-   Spatial Error Model

-   Spatial Durbin Watson Model

-   Geographically Weighted Regression Model

-   Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression Model

## Conclusion

This project finds that the overdose cases differed greatly in the eastern and central areas compared to other parts of Mesa. The geographically weighted poisson regression model was the best fit for this project as it created different models for each part of the city, which was greatly valuable in understanding how different risk factors affect different neighborhoods of the city.

## Suggestions

The government should focus on supporting the neighborhoods with high populations of minority groups, namely black and Hispanic residents. Specifically, the city should look into these populations in the western and central parts of the city, considering these places had the largest associations between race/ethnicity and overdose cases.

Similarly, in the eastern and west-central part of the city where median income is negatively correlated with overdose counts, the city should take preventive measures by aiding lower income families.

In the northwest of the city, the government should be mindful of residents who might be burdened by high costs of living as home-ownership is highly positively correlated with overdoses in this area.
